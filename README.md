# 🧬 Animal Cell Interactive Website

## 📋 Project Overview
This is an educational interactive website that visualizes an animal cell using modern web design techniques. Users can explore different parts of the cell through an intuitive interface, hovering over organelles to see their names and clicking on them to learn detailed information.

## 🎯 Key Features
- Interactive cell visualization with accurate organelle representation
- Detailed information panel for each cell component
- Color-coded legend to identify different cell parts
- Smooth animations and visual effects
- Responsive design for all device sizes

## 🧩 Cell Components
The visualization includes all major cell organelles:
- Nucleus and nuclear structures (nucleolus, nuclear envelope, chromatin)
- Protein synthesis structures (ribosomes, rough/smooth ER, Golgi apparatus)
- Energy-producing organelles (mitochondria)
- Transport and storage vesicles
- Waste management (lysosomes, peroxisomes)
- Structural elements (cytoskeleton, cell membrane)
- Specialized organelles (melanosomes, synaptic vesicles, etc.)

## 💻 Technical Implementation
- **HTML**: Structured layout with semantic elements
- **CSS**: Modern styling with gradients, shadows, and animations
- **JavaScript**: Dynamic creation of cell parts and interactive functionality
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes

## 🔄 User Interaction Flow
1. User arrives at landing page with welcome information
2. "Start Exploring" button takes user to interactive cell view
3. Hovering over cell parts shows tooltips with part names
4. Clicking on a part displays detailed information in the side panel
5. Legend helps identify all components by color

## 📝 Notes for Development
- Keep organelles anatomically accurate in position and appearance
- Ensure all parts are clickable with proper z-index management
- Optimize performance with efficient event handling
- Use color gradients to create a 3D-like appearance# 🧬 Animal Cell Interactive Website
